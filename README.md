# COVID-19_Case_Estimator
The project is a script that can be used to approximate the number of COVID-19 cases in your area based on deaths. Exponential growth can be difficult to grasp and many people are not tested due to lack of equipment. I hope that the script helps quantify the importance of taking action during this or any pandemic. 

## Instructions
1) Download or clone the script and the CVS file.
2) Edit the CVS file to reflect the information for your area 
3) Save the CVS file and run the script
